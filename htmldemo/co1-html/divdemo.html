The next generation saw the rise of stars like Chiranjeevi, known as the "Megastar," Balakrishna with his mass appeal, and the versatile actors Venkatesh and Nagarjuna. The current generation continues to dominate with immensely popular heroes like Pawan Kalyan, Mahesh Babu, Jr. NTR, Allu Arjun, and Ram Charan, who have not only achieved massive fan followings but have also brought Telugu cinema global recognition through blockbuster hits and pan-India appeal.
